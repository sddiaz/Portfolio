# Portfolio Projects - Clippit

The idea of this application is web-based message retrieval. It can be used from any device via a web browser. The goal here was to implement a database and make the UI look appealing (albeit simple) as well! Once again, small and simple, but something I was very proud of as it was my first personal HTML/CSS project!
