# Portfolio Projects - Password Generator

This simple password generator is nothing that hasn't been done a thousand times, so my goal was to make the UI experience the focal point. This was my first time really focusing on creating a pleasant UI, and I think I got the job done. Plenty of moving parts and things that are nice to look at. I included custom switches, a reactive slider, plenty of hover effects, an infinite carousel, and more. I learned a ton this project, mostly about organizing projects and working on creating clean code.

### What I learned

- Don't leave any "[Broken Windows](https://medium.com/@learnstuff.io/broken-window-theory-in-software-development-bef627a1ce99)" so to speak (I.E. tackle ALL edge cases for the best user experience!)
- Introduced to JavaScript and connecting it to DOM elements to behave as described (already familiar with OOP in C#/C++)
