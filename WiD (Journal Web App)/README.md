# Portfolio Projects - WiD

## Overview

This will (hopefully) be my largest project to date. It is very much in-progress as of now (5/12/23)! I wanted to build a full-stack web application that acts as a daily journal app. This project will test my ability to handle larger application, dealing with every end of the lifecycle of a software project myself. 

### Project Requirements

- User login system.
- Database to store user info
- Users create daily journal entries.
- Users can edit past entry content, but not future ones. 
- Lots more found in the documentation!

### Technologies Utilized

- ReactJS
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Real-Time Database
- HTML (no framework/library)
- CSS (no framework/library)
