# Portfolio Projects - EventBuzz

This project was designed to give me practice utilizing APIs in the form of a Chrome-Extension build! It's a lightweight chrome extension with numerous features listed below, with the main one being grabbing events from Google Events using SerpAPI. More details below. 

## Overview

### Project Requirements

- Backend API setup hosted on Vercel (to hide API key, we don't access the SerpAPI directly but rather access our backend API, which is linked to SerpAPI)
- Display Events by Search in a list of React Components
- Favorite events and store them in the browser's Local Storage
- Sorting Event list by Date
- Page through events
- Error Checking / Logic Integration

### Technologies Utilized

- React
- Axios (API requests)
- React-Spinners (Loading Animation)
- Vercel (hosting)
- CSS

### What I learned

- I learned how to setup a (very simple) backend API with proper techniques to hide an API key. 
- I honed in on my React skills, creating custom components and a clean UI design from scratch. 
- I learned how to access local storage and utilize state / effects to control an application seamlessly.
