# Portfolio Projects - Desktop Calendar

The infamous calculator project. Simple, small, with plenty of room for improvements (such as resizing).
Not much else to it. Dark mode and some extra flashiness for brownie points.  

I highly considered not putting this project anywhere near my
GitHub account, but I know it'll be a good reminder of where I came from after my skills have developed!

## Overview

### Project Requirements

- Research a pre-made design *image* on Dribbble, and bring it to life with code. 
- XAML Layout
- Appealing Design / Animations
- 2 Operand Functionality

### Technologies Utilized

- .NET 
- WPF
- C#

### What I learned

- Clean, well commented, maintainable code is a *must*... something I wouldn't say was perfected here.
- Responsive layouts are easier said than done! This being my first design didn't use them, but all of my other projects do / will.
